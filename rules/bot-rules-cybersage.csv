"Explain the importance of regularization in machine learning.", "Regularization is used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. It ensures the model is simple and generalizes well to new data."
"Compare supervised learning and reinforcement learning.", "In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, while in reinforcement learning, the agent learns through interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties for actions."

"What is a recurrent neural network?", "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed for sequence data, where the output of one step is fed as input to the next step."
"Compare and contrast precision and recall in classification.", "Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives, while recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positives to all actual positives."
"Explain the difference between a GAN and a standard neural network.", "A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consists of two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—that work against each other to generate realistic data, while a standard neural network typically consists of one model for prediction tasks."

"Explain the difference between gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.", "Gradient descent calculates the gradient of the entire dataset, while stochastic gradient descent calculates the gradient for one data point at a time, making it faster but more noisy."
"Compare Naive Bayes and Decision Trees.", "Naive Bayes assumes feature independence, whereas decision trees split the data based on feature values. Naive Bayes is fast and simple, while decision trees are more flexible but prone to overfitting."

"What is the purpose of a ReLU activation function?", "ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity. It allows for faster training and prevents the vanishing gradient problem."
"What are the advantages of ensemble learning?", "Ensemble learning combines multiple models to improve overall performance. It reduces overfitting and increases robustness by leveraging different models' strengths."
"What is a GAN and how does it work?", "A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consists of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—that are trained together in a game-like setting to generate realistic data samples."
"Why is multi-factor authentication important?", "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more forms of identification, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access."

"Why are outliers important in data analysis?", "Outliers can provide important insights into anomalies, errors, or rare events. However, they can also skew results and should be handled properly during preprocessing."
